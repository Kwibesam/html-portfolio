  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>Hi, I’m <strong>Samuel Ray (Samuel Raymond Kwibe)</strong>, a Computer Science student at
  Southern New Hampshire University in Manchester, NH. I’m focused on
  <strong>AI/ML</strong>, <strong>Cloud & DevOps</strong>, and <strong>Full-Stack Web Development</strong>.
  I enjoy turning real-world problems into simple, useful software and sharing what I learn along the way.
</p>

  <p>On the tech side, I build with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and I’m growing skills across AWS, Azure,
  and Google Cloud. Recent projects include a responsive health & skincare shop UI, a personal project
  organizer app, and hands-on cloud labs. Beyond coding, I write practical guides and book projects that
  help beginners get started with technology.
</p>

  <p>My goals are clear: become a highly skilled Cloud Architect and AI/ML Engineer, ship products that help
  people, and create opportunities for my community. If you’d like to collaborate or say hello, reach me at
  <a href="mailto:Samray@gmail.com">Samray@gmail.com.com</a> or connect on
  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-kwibe-371633249/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a>.
  Thanks for visiting!</p>
