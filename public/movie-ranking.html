            Fury's chase, freedom defined</p>

<h4>2. John Wick: Chapter 2 (2017)</h4>

            Through the night, the lone wolf's maul.</p>

<h3><b>Drama</b></h3>

    A modern musical that captures the bittersweet nature of pursuing one's </br>
    dreams in Los Angeles</br>
   , featuring compelling performances and beautifully crafted musical sequences.</p>


    <b><b>Poam</b></br></b>

            Notes and dreams under starlit sky,</br>

         <p><b>Poam</b></br>
            Boots tread light, on quest's bend,</br>
            Nine lives spent, seeks journey's end.</br>
            Whiskers twitch, dangerâ€™s dance,</br>
            For last wish, one more chance.</p>
